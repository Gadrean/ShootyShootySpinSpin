# Shooty Shooty Spin Spin
A game I made in Year 12 Using Adobe Flash and actionscript 3

## Aim of the Game
The point is to get the highest score. You get 1 point for every enemy you destroy.

The player starts with 10 health and once you get to 0 the game ends.

You lose health when enemies touch you.

Enemies endlessly come to attack you from the sides of the screen.

The player sits in the middle of the screen and can spin around to shoot in all directions.

The player has 15 ammo at a time and can only reload, which takes a little bit of time, when it reaches 0.

## Controls

The player can be controlled using the mouse or the keyboard.

When using the mouse the player will spin to face the cursor, left click shoots and right click reloads.

When using the keyboard the A and D keys are use to turn, the spacebar shoots and the W key reloads.
